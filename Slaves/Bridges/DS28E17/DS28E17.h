    * @brief DS28E17 1-Wire®-to-I2C Master Bridge
    *
    * @details The DS28E17 is a 1-Wire slave to I2C master bridge 
    * device that interfaces directly to I2C slaves at standard 
    * (100kHz max) or fast (400kHz max). Data transfers serially by 
    * means of the 1-Wire® protocol, which requires only a single data 
    * lead and a ground return. Every DS28E17 is guaranteed to have a 
    * unique 64-bit ROM registration number that serves as a node 
    * address in the 1-Wire network. Multiple DS28E17 devices can 
    * coexist with other devices in the 1-Wire network and be accessed 
    * individually without affecting other devices. The DS28E17 allows 
    * using complex I2C devices such as display controllers, ADCs, DACs,
    * I2C sensors, etc. in a 1-Wire environment. Each self-timed DS28E17 
    * provides 1-Wire access for a single I2C interface.
