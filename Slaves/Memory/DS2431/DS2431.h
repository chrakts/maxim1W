    * @brief DS2431 1024-Bit 1-Wire EEPROM
    * @details The DS2431 is a 1024-bit, 1-WireÂ® EEPROM chip organized 
    * as four memory pages of 256 bits each. Data is written to an 8-byte 
    * scratchpad, verified, and then copied to the EEPROM memory. As a 
    * special feature, the four memory pages can individually be write 
    * protected or put in EPROM-emulation mode, where bits can only be 
    * changed from a 1 to a 0 state. The DS2431 communicates over the 
    * single-conductor 1-Wire bus. The communication follows the standard 
    * 1-Wire protocol. Each device has its own unalterable and unique 
    * 64-bit ROM registration number that is factory lasered into the chip. 
    * The registration number is used to address the device in a multidrop, 
    * 1-Wire net environment.
