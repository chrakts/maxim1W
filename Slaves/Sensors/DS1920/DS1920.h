    * -55°C to +100°C in 0.5° increments. The iButton communicates with
    * a processor using the 1-Wire® protocol through a hardware port 
    * interface. The port interface provides both the physical link and 
    * handles the communication protocols that enable the processor to
    * access iButton resources with simple commands. Two bytes of 
    * EEPROM can be used either to set alarm triggers or for storing 
    * user data.
